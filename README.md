    - Your deployed URL (e.g., https://your-deployed-url.com)
  - Under Authorized redirect URIs, add:
    - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google (for local development)
    - Your deployed URL's callback endpoint (e.g., https://your-deployed-url.com/api/auth/callback/google)

3 Enable Required APIs:

5. Set Environment Variables:
   - Replace your-google-client-id and your-google-client-secret with your actual credentials.

## OpenAI API Setup

To use OpenAI GPT-4 for email classification, follow these steps:

1. **Create an OpenAI Account**:
   - If you don't already have an OpenAI account, sign up at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).

2. **Generate an API Key**:
   - After logging in, go to the [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - Click **Create API Key** to generate a new API key.
   - Copy the generated API key.
   - 
3. **Add API Key to the Application**:
   - Open your application and navigate to the home page.
   - You will see an input field to paste your OpenAI API key. 
   - Paste the API key into this field and click **Continue** to proceed to the email check page.

4. **Add API Key to Environment Variables (Optional)**:
   - For development purposes, you can also add the API key to your `.env.local` file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
     ```
     Replace `your-openai-api-key` with the API key you copied.
